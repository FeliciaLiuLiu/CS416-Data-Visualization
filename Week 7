1. Which of these best explains the name of the “D3” library?
Ans:
A. Data-Driven Documents – adding data to HTML elements
Exp:  D3 adds data to HTML documents.    

False:
A. D3 is the opposite of 3D – because D3 focuses on 2-D visualization
B. Desire, Decision, Determination – the formula for successful visualization
C. The previous library was named D2


2. Which of these is the most fundamentalcontribution of D3?
Ans:
A. D3 allows a web page to be accessed as a database.
Exp: D3’s fundamental contribution is its select methods that query the elements of an HTML web page and join them with data. 


False:
A. D3 allows a web page to be interactive.
Exp: Not quite – HTML web pages already have interaction, e.g., buttons.

B. D3 allows a web page to display a data visualization chart.
Exp: Not quite – D3 does do this, but another contribution is more fundamental to D3.

C. D3 allows a web page to include vector graphics.

3. The data method of D3 is designed to associate each data item with:
Ans:
A. A unique element in the web page
Exp: D3 joins data items with the SVG elements used to display them. 


False:
A. A unique SVG canvas in the web page.
Exp: Not quite – The SVG canvas is used to display all of the data items, 
but a separate SVG canvas is usually not created to display each individual data item.

B. A unique section of JavaScript code in the web page
Exp: Not quite – JavaScript is used to modify the web page based on the data items, 
but a unique section of code is not associated with each data item.

C. A unique CSS style in the web page


4. Which is returned by the following D3 code? d3.select(‘rect’).attr(‘height’,42)

Ans:
A. A reference to the selection
Exp: D3’s attr() method returns a reference to the selection 
so that subsequent attr() methods can be added to further modify the selection, even if the selection is a single element. 


False:
A. A reference to the height attribute    
Exp: Not quite – D3’s attr() method does not return a reference to the attribute itself.

B. A reference to the rectangle element
Exp: Not quite – D3’s attr() method does not return a reference to a particular element in a selection.

C. A reference to the number 42   



5. Let sel = d3.selectAll(“rect”).data(1,2,3,4)
Ans:
A. sel.enter() and sel.exit()
Exp: he Update section would contain all of the data items paired with all of the elements 
since there there is an equal number of both of them. 

False:
A. sel.exit() and sel
B. sel.update() and sel.enter()
C. sel and sel.update()


6. Let sel = d3.selectAll(“rect”).data(1,2,3,4)
If the web page was initialized with no rectangles, then the general update pattern states that the code should focus on which part of the selection?
Ans:
A. sel.enter()
Exp: The Enter section would mcontain (null,1), (null, 2), (null, 3), (null, 4), 
and the general update pattern would add .append(“rect”) to associate a new rectangle element with each data item. 

False:
A. sel
B. sel.exit()
C. sel.update()



7. If the (key,value) pairs of database A are (1,red), (2,green), (3,blue) 
and database B are (2,circle), (3,rectangle), (4,triangle), then which is the natural join A><B?
Ans:
A. (green,circle), (blue,rectangle)
Exp:
Both value pairs have matching keys in each of their respective databases. 


False:
A. (green,circle),(blue,rectangle), (red,triangle)    
B. (red,circle), (green,rectangle), (blue,triangle)
C. null



8. Given the SVG code <g transform=”translate(100,200)”><circle x=50, y=50, r=50></circle></g>
Which point in the SVG canvas is in the circle?
Ans:
A. 150, 250
Exp: The center of the circle is at the sum of its x,y attributes plus the transformation amount (100,200). 


False: 
A. 100, 200
Exp: Not quite. The x,y attributes of the circle still offset its center. 

B. 50, 50
Exp: Not quite. The translate should move the center of the circle to a new location. 

C. 250, 150



9. Given the SVG code <circle x=100, y=100, r=10></circle><circle x=100, y=200, r=20></circle>
Which is true?
Ans:
A. The radius 10 circle appears above the radius 20 circle.    
Exp:
In SVG, the origin is the upper left corner of the canvas, and positive y coordinates extend downward from the top of the canvas.


False:
A. The radius 20 circle appears above the radius 10 circle.



10. Consider a web page that displays the fields of a database on the left, 
and allows the user to drag these fields onto a canvas to add them to a visualization. 
The web page starts with a blank canvas and gives no further instructions. 
Which mode of visualization best describes this web page?

Ans:
A. Interactive Visualization
Exp: 
This visualization does not contain a narrative component, 
so it would be used to investigate data to answer a user's question, but does not tell a specific story. 

False:
A. Narrative Visualization
Exp: A narrative visualization uses the data visualization to tell a story, 
but the web page relies only the user to create the visualization and so is not in control of the story.

B. Interactive Storytelling
C. Presentation Visualization


11. If the (key,value) pairs of database A are (1,red), (2,green), (3,blue) 
and database B are (2,circle), (3,rectangle), (4,triangle), then which value is in the antijoin A<B?
Ans:
A. triangle
Exp: The antijoin would be specifically (null,triangle). 

False:
A. red
Exp: Not quite – red is in one of the antijoins, but not this one.

B. blue

C. circle



12. Let sel = d3.selectAll(“rect”).data(1,2,3,4)
If the web page was initialized with three rectangles, then which of the following is empty?
Ans:


False:
A. sel.update()
Exp: Not quite – the Update section would contain (rect,1), (rect,2), (rect,3).





13. Let sel = d3.selectAll(“rect”).data(1,2,3,4)
If the web page was initialized with five rectangles, then which of the following is empty?
Ans:
A. sel.enter()
Exp: 
The Enter section would not contain any data items that did not have a corresponding element, 
since there are fewer data items than elements. 

False:
A. sel
B. sel.update()
C. sel.exit()



14. If the (key,value) pairs of database A are (1,red), (2,green), (3,blue) 
and database B are (2,circle), (3,rectangle),(4,triangle), then which value is in the antijoin A>B?
Ans:
A. red
Exp: The antijoin would be specifically (red,null). 


False:
A. triangle
B. circle
C. blue
