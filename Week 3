1. Which of these mappings is the best choice if you want to visualize a data value 
but you don’t know if the value corresponds to a shirt’s price, size, or color?
Ans:
Position

False:
1. Color
2. Length
3. Area
Exp:
Position is the most effective perceptual mapping for quantitative (price), ordered (size), or nominal (color) values.




2. Which of these best characterizes how principal component analysis (PCA) is used for data visualization?
Ans:
To find low dimensional structure in a high dimensional dataset

False:
A. To find which dimensions of a high dimensional dataset the data varies the most
B. To find the best way to run an elementary school
C. To increase the dimensionality of a low dimension dataset to reveal hidden structure
Exp:
PCA uses the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of a high dimensional dataset 
to show the directions in the high dimensional space of the data where the data is varying the most.



3. Which of these is the least important criterion when visually ordering the elements of a chart.
Ans:
Displaying field values in database record order to facilitate interactivity through more rapid access times.


False:
A. Displaying plotted measure values in order from smaller to larger understand their extremes.
B. Clustering data based on similarity of one or more fields.
C. Listing ordinal field values in order to make them easier to find in a list.
Exp: The speed advantage for this ordering is likely negligible, and the user may infer some importance to the ordering.



4. Which best characterizes the betweenness centrality of a node?
Ans:
The portion of all the shortest paths between any two nodes that pass through the node


False:
A. The total distance to all other nodes
B. The number of nodes connected to a node by some path
C. The inverse of the distance to the farthest node
Exp:
The betweenness centrality (BC) is high for a node when it is visited often along the shortest path between other nodes, 
and can be used to simplify a graph (by removing edges between low BC nodes) or to reveal communities (by removing high BC nodes).


circle packing:
A visualization of the population of countries is visualized as the area of disks, which are packed in an arbitrary order


word cloud:
A visualization where the names of the counties are scaled by their population and packed in an arbitrary order




5. Which of these best characterizes what multidimensional scaling (MDS) is used for?
Ans:
To layout nodes in a complete graph (every node connected to every other node by an edge) according to desired edge lengths


False:
A. To layout nodes in a planar graph so that the edges do not cross
B. To find the shortest route among available flight connections from one airport to another
C. To find the directions in a high dimensional dataset where the data varies the most
Exp:
MDS is used to layout points when you are given the desired distances between the points.



6. Which of these choices is the most perceptually accurate way to map a quantitative value?
Ans:
The length of a bar in a bar chart


False:
A. The volume of a box in a 3-D bar chart
B. The area of a bar in a bar chart
C. The gray level of a bar in a bar chart
Exp: Length is more perceptually accurate at mapping quantitative values than the other choices.



7. In the Data Visualization Framework, what does the Mapping Layer do?
Ans: It associates geometry with data.

False:
A. It is the geographical map layer underneath a layer containing a chart of locations.
B. It maps user interaction into chart actions.
C. It ensures the data is in the proper format for visualization.
Exp:
The mapping layer associates appropriate geometry with corresponding data channels.




8. In which one situation below would be the most appropriate to treat the date data 
as a category variable instead of a quantitative continuous variable.
Ans:
Total annual sales for the year in order of best year to worst year.
Exp:
Because the order is not the date order, 
it would be inaccurate to treat measures over the dates as continuous and one would not want to interpolate between them.

False:
A. Sales on January 1st of each year in order from 2000 to 2020.
B. Sales at randomly chosen dates throughout the year, in date order.
C. Total sales for the decade in order of decade.



9. Which best characterizes a social network?
Ans:
A graph with many low degree nodes and fewer high degree nodes


False:
A. A graph with only low degree nodes
B. A graph with similar numbers of low degree and high degree nodes
C. A graph with fewer low degree nodes and many high degree nodes



10. Which best characterizes a tree map?
Ans:
The visualization of a tree of quantitative values as a hierarchy of rectangles where rectangle area corresponds to data value
Exp:
The rectangles corresponding to sibling nodes fit inside the rectangle corresponding to their parent node.


False:
A. The simplification of a tree to its essential backbone by removing nodes with low betweenness centrality.
B. The visualization of a tree where the root node is placed at the center of a circle and the leaf nodes are positioned on the circle.
C. The regions on a geographical choropleth map shaded green to indicate forests.


11. Which of these is a more perceptually accurate mapping of a quantitative value than the other options?
Ans:
As the y coordinate in a scatter plot

Exp:
Position is better than length, angle, and color for mapping a quantitative value.


False:
A. As the angle in a pie chart
B. As the color of a bar in a bar chart
C. As the length of a bar in a Gantt chart



12. Which of these is the best choice to visualize the sale of a shirt according to its shirt size?
Ans:
A bar chart
