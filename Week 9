3. Which of these scenarios best characterizes a martini glass structure?
Ans:

Exp:
Not quite – how would this map to the narrow stem and the widening bowl of a martini glass?

C. A slide show with the ability to drill down into the details in each slide.

4. Which of these scenarios best characterizes an interactive slideshow structure?
Ans:
A. A slide show with the ability to drill down into the details in each slide.

An interactive slide show consists of a main author-led pathway, 
but allows the viewer to explore some side paths that can drill down into details in a slide, 
though these side paths are often also author-led.

Exp:
Not quite – while the slide shows begin with interactions, they themselves might not be interactive.

B. A single scene with displayed annotations that highlight key data points.
Exp:
Not quite – how does this map to the slides of a slide show?
