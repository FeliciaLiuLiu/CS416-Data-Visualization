1. You’re given two circles of the same size. The left one is surrounded by smaller circles and the right one is surrounded by larger circles. 
Which circle appears larger?
Ans:
The left one.

False:
1. The right one.
2. Neither.
Exp:
The perceptual processing of the human visual system is designed not to ignore differences but to accentuate them.



2. When visualizing data, you should keep your eyes focused on one point for the entire duration of the visualization.
Ans:
False, because your visual system will play tricks on your perception of the data.

False:
True, because your visual system will better detect any changes to datapoints during the visualization.
Exp:
As we showed in the slides, focusing on a single point causes a temporal inhibition in the light sensors and can play tricks on your perception.


3. Which one of the 3-D depth cues below indicates surface orientation?
Ans:
Illumination

False:
1. Occlusion
2. Stereopsis
3. Shadowing

Exp:
Occlusion and shadowing only indicate the surface closest to the observer (or light source), 
and stereopsis provides relative cues of distance across an image, 
whereas the illumination of a surface changes based on how the surface is facing the light source (and for specular reflection, the viewer).


4. In what order does a data visualization graphics pipeline process information?
Ans:
Vertex processing, then rasterization, then pixel processing

Exp:
The graphics pipeline accepts vector graphics primitives described as vertices, so it processes vertices first. 
Rasterization converts vector graphics primitives into the pixel locations used to display them on a display screen. 
Pixel processing is used to further process the pixels output from rasterization, e.g., to compute their individual colors.



5. How many items can human working memory (short-term memory) typically hold?
Ans:
3–7 items

False:
1. 30–70 items
2. 300–700 items
3. 3,000-7,000 items

Exp: 
Our working memory can only hold 3–7 items at a time, 
though a single item in our working memory can be a collection of items in our long-term memory.

6. 
Given a plot of life expectancy based on country and birth year, you look up your country and birth year, 
find the displayed life expectancy, and conclude you will probably live that long. This is an example of 

Ans:
Deductive reasoning

False:
1. Inductive reasoning
2. Subductive reasoning
3. Abductive reasoning

Exp:
This is an example of deductive reasoning because we are drawing the conclusion implied by the given data.


7. A light gray box drawn on top of a dark gray background will make the light gray box appear ______________.
Ans:
Brighter
Exp:
The dark gray box will make the light gray box appear even brighter 
because the human visual system's lateral inhibition will detect and accentuate the difference.

False:
1. The same as it appears on a white background
2. Darker


8. Which one of the following is NOT an element of vector graphics?
Ans:
Pixels

False:
1. Strokes
2. Vertices
3. Fills
Exp:
While vector graphics are sometimes converted to a rectilinear raster graphics array of pixel color values for display on a raster device, 
some applications work directly from the vector graphics specification, such as a plotter or a laser display.


9. Which one of the 3-D depth cues below is the strongest?
Ans:
Occlusion

False:
1. Shadowing
2. Lighting
3. Stereopsis
Exp:
Occlusion is the strongest cue, because if a point on object A and object B project to the same point on the image plane, 
the fact that you see object A and not object B at that point provides incontrovertible evidence of a depth ordering that A is closer than B.
